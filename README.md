1. Navigate to the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. Open the project settings ('gear icon' next to project name).
3. In *Your Apps -> Web Apps* select on **Config** under *Firebase SDK snippet*.
4. Copy the ``firebaseConfig`` JSON object's content into ``src/firebaseConfig.js``.
